GUODA is a collaboration between developers and technical staff at [EOL](http://eol.org/),
[iDigBio](https://www.idigbio.org/), and interested independent contractors.
The initial group met during the June 2015 [iDigBio API hackathon](https://github.com/idigbio-api-hackathon)
and since have been meeting regularly to discuss projects using Apache Spark and 
biodiversity datasets to build tools to explore broad biodiversity questions.
