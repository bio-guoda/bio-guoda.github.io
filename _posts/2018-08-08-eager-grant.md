The Advanced Computing and Information Systems lab ([ACIS](https://www.acis.ufl.edu/), the iDigBio cyberinfrastructure partner, 
received an EAGER award from NSF. Written in response to the Advancing Long-term Reuse of Scientific 
Data Dear Colleague letter, the goal will be to examine identifier practices and quantify how those 
practices influence our ability to link data together into graphs with recommendations for future 
improvements. Over the next two years we will be assembling open biodiversity data, constructing 
graphs of relationships, and reporting on our successes and challenges. This proposal came as a direct 
result of our experiences in the Global Unified Open Data Access collaboration (GUODA) between ACIS, 
iDigBio, the Encyclopedia of Life, the Ronin Institute, the Royal Botanic Gardens Kew, and independent 
developer Jorrit Poelen.
