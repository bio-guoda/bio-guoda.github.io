GUODA is providing a Jupyter Hub server for running Jupyter notebooks on top of 
the Spark cluster and shared data repository that forms the GUODA 
infrastructure.

[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) provide a web-based interface for 
writing data analysis and exploration code (Python and R are supprted in GUODA)
and making the code, discussion, and output availible to everyone in one
document. [An example](https://github.com/iDigBio/idb-spark/blob/master/notebook/Cardinality_of_iDigBio_Data.ipynb)

The ACIS lab is making this service publicly availible for any researcher with
a GitHub login at [https://jupyter.idigbio.org/](https://jupyter.idigbio.org/).
Documentation can be found on the [guoda-service wiki](https://github.com/bio-guoda/guoda-services/wiki/Jupyter-Notebooks).
