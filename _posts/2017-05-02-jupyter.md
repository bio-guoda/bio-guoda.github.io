GUODA is providing a JupyterHub server for running Jupyter notebooks
on top of the Spark cluster and shared data repository that forms the GUODA 
infrastructure. There is an overview of the [GUODA infrastructure]().

[Jupyter notebooks](http://jupyter.org/) provide a web-based interface for 
writing data analysis and exploration code (Python is fully supported in GUODA and R is in development)
and making the code, discussion, and output available to everyone in one
document. This blog post at iDigBio is [an example](https://github.com/iDigBio/idb-spark/blob/master/notebook/Cardinality_of_iDigBio_Data.ipynb)
of the output from a notebook being embedded into a web site.

The [ACIS lab](https://acis.ufl.edu/) is making this service publicly available for any researcher with
a GitHub login at [https://jupyter.guoda.bio/](https://jupyter.guoda.bio/).
Documentation can be found on the [guoda-service wiki](https://github.com/bio-guoda/guoda-services/wiki/Jupyter-Notebooks)
on Github.
