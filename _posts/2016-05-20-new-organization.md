GUODA now has a [Github organization](https://github.com/bio-guoda) for all code
related to the core data processing service. This code can be used to replicate
our work or to expand on it.

The first major repository is [guoda-datasets](https://github.com/bio-guoda/guoda-datasets)
which will hold scripts and workflows for obtaining and formating datasets from external
projects for use in GUODA.
