Preston is an open-source software system that keeps track of biodiversity datasets. Scientists can use Preston to keep a local, uniquely identifiable, versioned copy of all or parts of [GBIF](https://gbif.org)-indexed datasets. Institutions can use Preston to check that their collections are indexed and available through [iDigBio](https://idigbio.org). Biodiversity informatics researchers can use Preston to perform metadata analysis. And finally, archivists can distribute archives across the world.

For more information see the [Preston project](https://preston.guoda.bio).
